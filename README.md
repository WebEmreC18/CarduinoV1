# Project Carduino

This is a simple beginner project with Arduino. 
In this project we are going to build a car controlled with an Arduino.
The main purpose of this project is to get a basic knowledge of electronics and programming on Arduino.
What we want to do is, to build a small car with simple controlling (FORWARD, BACKWARD, RIGHT, LEFT, ACCELERATE)
This is the first version of this project.
In further versions there could be some updates like turning the lights on/off, object-detection, etc.
